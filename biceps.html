<strong>Biceps:</strong>

<p>Choose 3, and perform 3-5 sets with 10-15 reps (6 if bulking) for everything<br><br>

	<strong>Preacher Curls</strong> - they are the curls in which you lean over some structure similar to like a tilted table with fabric. I prefer to use a curling bar and aim for 3 sets with 15 , 11, 11 reps in each set while
increasing weight. This workout is great for building bulk in your biceps.<br><br>

	<strong>Standard Curls</strong> - Typical curls, you can do them sitting with isolation , standing with a twist at the end for more of a cannon ball look, or laying down on a bench for shoulder isolation.
Anyway you choose to do it, you need to decide between more bulk or more definition. If definition is your case go for 10 on each arm while taking your time doing it and aim for form. If you are going
for bulk aim for heavy 6 rep sets.<br><br>

	<strong>Hammer Curls</strong> - Hard as fuck to do so the weight wont be much but basically its the curl where you are literally bringing the top "Hammer Head" of the dumbell straight up to your biceps. Bend your elbow
and dont move your shoulder please. Its a bad ass workout for building the longer head of your bicep if im not mistaken. You can also replace this with Rope Pulls]
*Rope Pulls* - hard to explain but its bascially when you take the rope used for triceps  - place iot on the lower section of the suspension machine and pull up into a double curl. It hits it just like
hammer curls except its easier for those who cant do them, but at the cost of a shittier workout.<br><br>

	<strong>Pullups</strong> - God tier workout, not good for me because It really digs into my hands without gloves and for awhile my jumpshot paid for college and I couldn't be having that. For YOU THOUGH! it is an awesome
exercise and you should start off by doing negative pull ups to get into it. Negative pulls ups are when you take a chair jump up and slowly let your self come down while controlling it. It gives you the work out of a pull up
but in reverse for those who cant do it! Eventually you will be able to do them and it gets better and better. I started off being able to do 1/2 and finished doing sets of 15. Eventually you want to switch the grip
from a chip up to a real military style marine pull up where its over handed.<br><br>

	<strong>Suspension machine</strong> - you can do anything for biceps here and theres tons of workouts so im not going to go into it but remember it will cut them up and make them tight and vacular but you wont really get BIGGER biceps this
way. For me I already had big arms of fat so it helped so much by just shaping the fuck out of that. Look up some or watch others. There is NO shame in learning at the gym bro.<br><br>

	<strong>Standing Curls</strong> - Similar to the single ones with dumbbells but done with a curling bar and a medium weight. This can be done in so many ways incuding "21"s look it up for more info. You can do them in serts of 10 standing
up for an awesome workout as well. You can even do them reverse grip for a hammer curl style workout! becareful of forearm pain with this one though.<br><br>

There are tons of workouts find the 3 that work for you. Biceps suck and its important to find the 3 that work and just get it over with :D<br><br>
