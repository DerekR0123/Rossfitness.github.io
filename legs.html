<p>Choose 3, and perform till fatigue with form. I am not going to give you a specific amount of reps because it should be judged at the time 
of performance.<br><br>

Once again I will reiterate that your Legs may be one of the strongest muscles in your body and able to take the most punishment,
that however shouldn't justify you to just mindlessly lift and try to max everything out with them. You want to keep your legs safe and more importantly
the joints connected to them. You should also be aware that Legs have a great impact in cardio and your ability to do future cardio. A lot of great
experts in the field of health will even go as far as to say Leg day counts as a cardio day as well.<br><br>

<strong>Squats</strong> - One of the oldest exercises known to man. You should begin with minimal to no weight while you stretch every time.
Once you are warm you can begin to perform weighted squats - of course when you feel comfortable. You should perform each and every rep by positioning
your legs a little wider then shoulder width, bar rested right below your neck and on your traps, and a firm plant in your feet and grip for your hands. Once you
have all the outside aspects ready you may perform your squat by bending at the knee's, keeping your back straight, and attempting to go atleast 90 degree's in your
movement. There are such things as quarter and half squats but for the sake of progression just stick to less weight and 
closer to 90 degree's of a movement.Stay away from the smith machine unless you are brand new or have injuries - you will not benefit your
self there. I would say something like 3 sets of 10 should be sufficient but for legs you should judge it based on each and every
time you attempt to do these things.<br><br>


<strong>Calf Raises</strong> - In my opinion the best workout for making your life easier. Will take pain off your knee's ,
will make running easier, going up the stairs easier, and even make you jump higher! Calf raises can be done with a multitude of places and ways.
You can do them by holding heavy dumbells, a machine for calfs - note there are many: some while sitting by adding plates, some standing by moving the key in the plate stack,
and even some with a harness depending on how expensive your gym is. I personally prefer to do it with dumbells or the standing machine.
Either way the principle all remains the same - the goal is to firmly plant your feet shoulder width apart and raise your self to the top of your
"tippie" toes. You are essentially performing something similar to a flexing of your calf muscles but with weight. You will most definitly feel it almost
immediately. For calfs I would aim for somewhere between 20-30 for atleast the first two sets and you can drop for the last - last few. I like to do 3-5 sets 
of calf raises.<br><br>

<strong>Lunges</strong> - These are a great movement for your legs and are done with and to my knowledge only using dumbells or a bar on your shoulders.
Don't expect to do a lot of weight with these because its all about how low you can go and how many you can do. The goal is to basically bend one leg
at a time till you have your knee gently reach an inch or so from the ground and then stand back up and repeat for the opposite side. You
do this hopefully for 10 times on each side and for 3 sets. This of course is just a magic number and you should base it off how you feel. Same goes for
weight and what you have available between dumbells and bars with weight. <br><br>

<strong>Dead Lifts</strong> - I will go over these during the back section of the website since they really workout the back a lot more.
They are however a great leg workout and should be noted! Note these are not a beginner movement and should not be done till you have a grasp on most
things or atleast a decent start out for your muscles.<br><br>

<strong>Leg raises / declines</strong> - These are a done with specific machines at the gym and rarely home benches that have that weird pole sticking out
on the end. If you have one of those weird benches you put plates on the pole that extends at the end and usually there are two foam rollers that you would place your legs under or
over depending on how advance it is. As for how to do the movements they are almost exactly how they look. You place your legs either underneath
the foam rollers or above them preferably with your knee's held in place by one of the supporting pads and your ankles having the foam rollers lined up right on them.
Once all factors are in place you either raise or tuck your legs in depending on the movement.The reason why is because it 
will isolate the muscles in the perfect way for both movements. You can do I would say 2-3 sets of each of these and I would count them
more as a half set rather then a whole set. I would combine them for one whole set.<br><br>


<strong>Leg Press</strong> - These are one of my favorite workouts to do. i got started with these because I had bad knee's
for squats. These can replace the motion of squating by having you sit in a machine that has either two foot rests or one large foot rest in front of you
with pole sticking out on the sides and possibly the top. Once you put the weight you desire the goal is to lift the stack - unhook the safety gaurds and perform
once again a 90 degree movement in which you let the weight slowly come down with you and then push it back till you are straight.
This is a great way to replace squats if you have pain from them or dislike them. Some will argue that they are not as good as squats but if
you aren't doing squats properly then you really aren't gaining that much anyways. I highly recommend these for new comers, injury or injury prone people, or
people who wish to save / have bad knee's. I dont fit into any of those but I really can't get low enough in a squat for full effect so these
are perfect for me!<br><br>
