		    <h1><strong>Triceps:</strong></h1>

<p>Choose 3, and perform 3-5 sets with 11-15 reps and drop as you go heavier<br><br>

	<strong>Pull downs</strong> - This is done on a suspension machine with a rope or with a triangle handle. Just pull down and twist out at the end to extend out
	your hands outward. This is one of the best exercises because its near impossible to replicate it with free weights in the exact manor.
	A few things to note: Yes you can do a lot of weight and should, but you shouldn't be maxing the stack with poor form - form is everything here. The next thing
	is dont be using your back and shoulders to force the weight down - it should be a smooth motion. <br><br>

	<strong>Bar pulldowns</strong> - This is when you take one of the bar attatchments and you pull it down with two different hand grips to effect two different tricep heads.
You want a handgrip underhanded to get the back of your triceps and an overhanded one for the front. These are AWESOME if you do it slow and with good form. The underhanded one is much harder
	so you should perform this first. You should really try not to use any other muscles and lock your elbows for full effect.<br><br>

	<strong>Rope extenntions</strong> - For this workout you take that rope you used for pull downs and pull it so its one long rope instead of being divided into two. You pull down with one hand
and bend your wrist out. It is basically the motion of flexing your tricep in a staight downward motion with a twist downwards. It really brings out the part of your Triceps that pops out in the front; 
	Its the front most tricep head that pops out on your arm.<br><br>

	<strong>Tricep pushups / bench</strong> - These are two exellent free weight exercises. The reason I put them together is because you usually
	dont have enough energy left in your arms to do both of them as a beginner - or if you are doing all free weights.
	For the bench workout it's a close grip  bench that you essentially put all the pressure in a straight up and down motion on your triceps.
	It IS NOT A DIAMOND form or motion - that will really hurt your wrists - remember is close-grip going up and down. For the pushups
	This IS A diamond style motion. You position your hands very close in a diamond fashion and let your triceps extend out. These are very hard
	but if you are the type of person to workout at home - these will be your go'to's. <br><br>

	<strong>Skull Crushers</strong> - This workout is a tough one and should really be followed up with a video in order to save any damage done to your wrists.
	The goal of this workout is to lay on a bench or the floor if you have to and grab preferably an easy curl bar or standard bar.
	You bring the bar up and out to begin - and as you perform the workout you bring it towards your head and exteend it out by bending your elbows.
	The motion when done properly is fully done with the use of your wrists and triceps. Its basically like extending out your triceps with weights on them.
	Please be careful and take your time with these. <br><br>

	<strong>Dumbbell kickbacks</strong> - For this workout you can do this in two ways. The beginner way is when you lean over something like a chair or a bench
	and hold a dumbbell near your side. Once you are ready you bend your elbow straight backwards and extend your tricep. You can do this with a few different handgrips
	to try to work out the different(3) tricep heads. The harder version comes when you sit with your back properly in place and take that same dumbell but put it
	behind your head and hold it with two hands. This time you will be bending upwards with only one option of a hand grip. This workout replicates sort of a tricep pull down
	but in reverse fashion with a much harder degree of difficulty. Please be very careful with your shoulders when positioning the dumbell and work on hand placement
	for how you hold the dumbell. <br><br>

	<strong>Dips</strong> - In a standard dip you tend to work out both your chest and your triceps (Mostly the Chest), but there are a lot of ways where you can isolate the triceps
	in a much better fashion. There are machines that do this perfectly , but for the sake of those who don't have them or are looking for a tougher challenge the goal would be for you to
	perform the dip in this mannor. Place your self on the two bars that extend out for your dip - Lean your self on your upper body forward - and proceed to just bend your triceps
	and perform extensions without going low. The lower you go the more pressure is put on your chest and taken from your triceps. The goal is to just to the range of motion
	that effects your triceps. If you do not have access to this (Home Gym Hero's!) you can perform it by taking two things like benches or chairs and make a bridge
	with your body and them using your hands on the structure behind you to lift up an extend them. You can even put a plate on your lap if you want to increase the difficulty.<br><br>
