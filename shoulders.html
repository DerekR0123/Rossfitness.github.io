<p>Choose 3, and perform 3-5 sets with 10-15 reps (6 if bulking) for everything<br><br>


Ill break them up into two gigantic routines I do. <br><br>

  <u>Routine 1: At Home with Dumbells</u><br>
  <strong>21's.</strong><br>
3-5 sets of the following while sitting on a chair or bench preferably with the back raised up.
You take two (I use 20lb) dumb bells, do 7 alternating (7 on each side, 14 total) straight raises with your elbows locked (Dont go past the point where your arm isn't straight) for each arm, 7 side raises 
  (Same principle as straight raises though you may slack the elbow lock a bit) at the same time for each arm, and 7 shoulder presses (there are a few different styles to this but any will do).
This is 1 set, NO BREAKS inbetween any of that only after all 21 reps (7 for each arm unless you are doing at same time) are complete. Aim for 3 sets with full reps starting off and work your way to 5.
20 maybe too much or too little for you. For me ive always done 20 and I cant really get past 25 lb for shoulders with this so I wouldn't worry about weight so much as form.
  <br><br>

  <u>Routine 2: At Gym</u><br>
  <strong>Suspension Machine + Shoulder Press Stations</strong><br>
Basically the same shoulder workout for front raise except with a cable for a nice isolation 20-30 lbs for me idk about you.
Basically same shoulder workout for side raises except the cable is in front of you when you are raising it, again 20-25 here lbs for me.
Shoulder press - There are some gyms with a nice sitting press for it, some with machines, or you can do dumb bells / military style press. just basically an upward press for your shoulders.
Arnold is the best form for dumbbells if you choose dumbbells. If im at the gym I use the shoulder press rack with 95, 115, 135 lb's with a bench press bar.
  <br><br>

There are tons of workouts besides these, find the 3 workouts that work best for YOU. Best of Luck to you<br><br>
