		    <h1><strong>Biceps:</strong></h1>

<p>Choose 3, and perform 3-5 sets with 10-15 reps (6 if bulking) for everything<br><br>

	<strong>Preacher Curls</strong> - these are the curls in which you lean over some structure similar to like a tilted table with fabric. I prefer to use a curling bar and aim for 3 sets with 15 , 11, 11 reps in each set while
increasing weight. This workout is great for building bulk in your biceps. The real goal of this movement is to isolate your shoulders out of the lift. It puts all the pressure on your biceps and forearms.<br><br>

	<strong>Standard Curls</strong> - Typical curls, you can do them Standing(Normal), sitting / laying on a bench with isolation(on your shoulders) or Standing(Harder Version) keeping your arm locked out front. Attempt to do them with a twist at the end for more of a cannon ball look.
Anyway you choose to do it, you need to decide between more bulk or more definition. If definition is your case go for 10-15 on each arm while taking your time doing it and aim for form. If you are going
for bulk aim for heavy 6-8 rep sets.<br><br>

	<strong>Hammer Curls</strong> - Very Hard to do so the weight wont be much but basically its the curl where you are literally bringing the top "Hammer Head" of the dumbell straight up to your biceps. Bend your elbow
and dont move your shoulder please. Its an awesome workout for building the longer head of your bicep . You can also replace this with Rope Pulls
*Rope Pulls* - hard to explain but its bascially when you take the rope used for triceps  - place it on the lower section of the suspension machine and pull up into a double Hammer curl. It hits it just like
hammer curls except its easier for those who cant do them, but isn't as good of a workout(If you have forearm pains or problems go with these).<br><br>

	<strong>Pullups</strong> - Top of the Line workout,I would recommend that you start off by doing negative pull ups to get into it. Negative pulls ups are when you take a chair jump up and slowly let your self come down while controlling it. It gives you part of the work out of a pull up
for those who cant do it - One rep pull up isn't as good as ten negative pull ups or assisted pull ups. Eventually you will be able to do them and it gets better and better. I started off being able to do 1/2 and finished doing sets of 15. Eventually you want to switch the grip
from a chip up to a real military style marine pull up where its over handed and you work on the form.<br><br>

	<strong>Suspension machine</strong> - you can do anything for biceps here and theres tons of workouts so im not going to go into it but remember it will cut them up and make them tight and vacular but you wont really get BIGGER biceps this
way. Look up some workouts or watch others do them in person. There is NO shame in learning, and I will re-iterate one more time - USE FREE WEIGHTS FOR BULK.<br><br>

	<strong>Standing Curls</strong> - Similar to the single ones with dumbbells but done with a curling bar and a medium to heavy weight. This can be done in so many ways incuding "21"s look it up for more info. You can do them in serts of 10 standing
up for an awesome workout as well. You can even do them reverse grip for a hammer curl style workout! becareful of forearm pain with the hammer version though.
	Standing Curls hits the peak of your biceps and you have a lot of ways of going about it between high reps or high weight <br><br>

There are tons of workouts find the 3 that work for you. Biceps suck and its important to find the 3 that work and just get it over with :D<br><br>
