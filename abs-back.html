              <u><h1>Back:</h1></u>
              <p>

<br><br>

                <strong>Lateral Pull downs</strong> -  3 sets, I usually do 100 pounds (my weight = 230) - you should aim for 3 sets with like 1/3 - 1/2 your body weight. Its the machine with a really wide bar
                on the suspension machine where people lean back and pull it to there ribs. The goal is to try not to use your legs or arms to much
                in the motion. You should lean back enough that you can bring it down in one smooth motion. <br><br>

                <strong>Overhead pull downs</strong> - 3 sets, 100-150 pounds (Again I weigh 230). Aim for 1/3 or so of your body weight. 
                Same machine except you lean forward slightly and pull it down to your traps and shoulders. The goal is the same to take your legs
                and arms out of the motion as much as possible and focus on the form and contraction of the movement.<br><br>

                <strong>Rows</strong> - 3 sets - aim for 1/2 - 1x your body weight. On the suspension machine there's a long
                bench that you can sit on and grab a triangle looking bar handle and pull back till 
your elbows each your ribs. This is called a row, and its a great exercise with weight. It is also done with dumbells in a bent over position
                where the user will bring the weight up till there arm makes an L shape. I have even seen people do it with a weight stack or bar bell
                and they bring it right up the center till they reach again the bottom of their ribs. <br><br>

                <strong>Dead Lifts</strong> - These are something that I don't recommend for new comers or anyone with a bad back. It is a great
                exercise that will help you not only train your legs and back but also help you lose weight. A dead lift is performed usually using a squat bar at
                and starts off on the floor. You then take a firm grip - most people do one hand overhand and one hand under hand - and then you begin
                to stand up while straightening your back. It is one smooth motion and should never be forced or attempted to be chucked up. If you have to
                do any of this then the weight is too much for you and you should lighten the load. With all of this being said there are other tools
                that are at your disposal for easier dead lifts and possibly safer / beginner versions. There is one where you step into an octagon / circle like bar where you pick
                the weight up on the outside of you and perform the same deadlift but with the handles on your sides and you in the middle. There also some
                machines that can replicate it or if ALL ELSE FAILS you can attempt to use the smith machine but I wouldn't bother at that point. I have tried
                it with free weights and while its not as good it still serves a purpose if you are a home gym user and have to use whats at your disposal. <br><br>

                <u><h1>Abs:</h1></u> <br><br>
               
             <p> 

               <strong>Leg Raises</strong> - This is that weird little stand looking thing usually with half of a fitness ball in the back
               with two handles to hold on - or atleast a pad. You would enter in the little spot that can fit you and turn out facing the
               way you entered. You basically do a set of 20 reps, 10 reps with knee's lifting + 10 reps with legs straight out lifting. 
               3 sets of these are the goal. You can add weight by holding it clamped either between your groin or feet depending on your skill 
               level. I have even seen some people attatch weights around there waist. <br><br>

               <strong>Planks</strong> - Wonderful workout inwhich you put your self in a position similar to a pushup with the exception that
               you are leaning on your elbows instead of pushed up on your hands. The goal here is to have your arms bent out in front of you in a
               sideways L shape. You kind of look like you are praying except the rest of your body is in a pushup position. The goal here is to
               hold it for 1-2 minutes per set,  for 2-3 sets. You can even put plates on your back with a friend to add difficulty or increase the time span
               of the duration for the planks. <br><br>

               <strong>Decline situps</strong> - situps on a decline(slope) in which your head is lower to the ground and your legs
               are closer to the ceiling. The goal here is to do 10 reps per set and x 3 sets in total. <br><br>

               <strong>Oblique turns</strong> - Machine or with medicine ball - the goal is to turn your body with a weight and you should feel it.
               Usually done while sitting and only moving your torso with your legs and arms isolated out of the movement. <br><br>


               <strong>Leg extensions</strong> - Very similar to planks except you are laying on your back - and you lift you legs 6 inches
               off the ground and hold it there for about 30 seconds to a minute and you can even tilt to each side to work some oblique's too.<br><br>

               <strong>Lower AB Crunches</strong> - This is when you hold a bench and move your legs out extended and bring them back in. This Works the lower abs
               really well. The goal is to try to hold on to the bench and contract your self like an accordian by only moving your legs out and in 
               and firmly contracting your stomach muscles. <br><br>

               <strong>Bicycles</strong> - This is exactly like it sounds, you lay on your back - lift your legs up and perform a 
               biycle motion with a good spread and cycle between your legs. Perform this for 1min per set for  x 3 sets. <br><br>

               <strong>Rope crunches / Machine Crunches / Regular Sit Ups</strong> - Never worked for me but a lot of people do it. Up to you but its basically a situp done
               while you are sitting and either holding the rope behind your head or have handles behind your head to hold on to. Once you have a firm grip
               you proceed to crunch downwards till your elbows reach your thighs. For reps I would repeat the usual 10 reps for x3 sets and for weight
               thats something you should judge by how you feel and perform them. Regular Situps should be done either with your legs held by a
               partner / bench or done by laying on your back and raising your legs in the air "indian style" and aiming to reach your elbows
               to your knee's on contraction. The reps for this should be based on how you feel. If you do too many you will really be hurt for a few
		     days but if you do too little then you really aren't being fair to your self.<br><br>
