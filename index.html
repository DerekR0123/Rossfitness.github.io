              <p>Before you even bother trying to change your routines or the way your muscles look you need to change what you put into them. You need to change this because in the long run it will be the most effective in helping your life.
              Changing your Diet isn't something you wake up tomorrow and flip the switch, you need to do it in stages and do it properly or you will become very sick. </p><br>

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Change All Your Drinks to Water</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		    <td>All the sugar and calories from drinks adds up to a lot over time. Most Sugary drinks contain atleast 100 calories and we go through several glasses a day.</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Dont Eat Late</td>
		    <td>2</td>
		    <td>When You eat late it can't be properly digested and it almost always turns right to fat. You should start off with a cut off point of either 9 or 10 and work your way down as low as you can for a longer fasting period while you sleep.</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Cut out the Snacks</td>
		    <td>3</td>
		    <td>At this point you should aim to cut out snacking. Most people are subconscious eaters and will snack and over eat without realizing. You should avoid snacking or atleast cut out anything that isn't healthy or reasonable. You deserve a treat but not a feast</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Add Veggies</td>
		    <td>4</td>
		    <td>One of the easiest ways to greatly impact a diet is to alter the exact same thing you currently eat. Start by taking a quarter of the meal you eat and replace it with a bunch of vegtables like broccoli. You will be able to eat an insane amount of veggies compared to what you cut out so you will become full and cut out a large portion of calories. The goal would be to even out the proportions but its one step at a time here.</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Quality Control</td>
		    <td>5</td>
		    <td>Now the goal is to change the quality of the type of things you eat. You aren't expected to cold cut give up things yet but you should try to get healthy versions. Maybe get a veggie pizza or a sandwhich in a wrap or substitute the fries. Even if all else fails dab the oil and grease off. Dieting is a game of wins and losses, you want to get as many wins as you can.</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Avoiding Certain Foods</td>
		    <td>6</td>
		    <td>Now that you have altered your diet pretty well and are adjusting you should begin to avoid certain foods. This isn't being drastic and saying dont have any but you should avoid them if you can. Bread is a huge thing to avoid, Sugar obviously we discussed, but now we should avoid starch and some dairy if possible. With this being said be smart about it. You dont need a lot of bread, pasta, or whole milk unless you are some kind of super athlete.</td>

		    <br><br> <strong>To Close out Dieting</strong> I do want to mention yet again that a lot of people fall into the trap of over eating due to them feeling like they've earned it. I used to do this all the time and it sucks - it really does. I would recommend that if you are killing your self in your workouts to the point where you need to over eat - cut back the workout. You can save your body and still get the results if you Tune the Dieting end of the spectrum first.</p><br><br>
              
		<strong>Supplements</strong>
          <p> As far as supplements go I really dont beleive in them. Unless you are trying to be some perfect instagram model
you dont need to take some crazy shit thats usually expensive anyways. I do however recommend some kind of CLEAN NOT
            EXPENSIVE preworkout and you <strong>NEED PROTEIN</strong>. Ill go into more detail here with each of them and why.<br><br>

            <strong>Preworkout</strong> - Why? It basically for the most part gives you the energy to actually do what you want to do. Some of them even
heighten your body's levels to sweat and get really into your workout. They come in all sorts of forms and if you are like me and
you have problems with caffine stay away from the pills ESPECIALLY WEIGHT LOSS PILLS. I use some lower caliber Preworkout I bought
from the Online. Its nothing special but it really changes the feeling when you feel like shit and need to work out. It gives me
full energy and focus but theres one down side. It tastes horrible. It will also keep you awake so if you work out at night it may not be for you.<br><br>

            <strong>Protein</strong> - Why? If you take protein compaired to a guy who doesn't and do the same workouts and the same efficiency and you have the same genes, you will
gain 6 months of results in 4 months, while he will gain 4. Protein elevates the rate of recovery for your muscles allowing you to really get the most out of your workouts
that should be completed twice a week if you REALLY want those results and changes in your life. You should be buying a protein with atleast 24g of protein per scoop.
Preferably get something with chocolate for taste! I beleive everyone can afford protein they have all sorts everywhere for all various prices. If you
can't afford it you should work on getting some cheap sources like peanut butter. Dont buy the expensive arnold crap they try to sell you unless you can afford it. Standard Gold Whey Protein,
Take protein according to how much you weigh. I weigh 235 so two scoops (48g)+ 12 ounces of milk (like 6g) gets me roughly near 54g of protein.
You can only take like 1g per 1lb a day if im not mistaken and you have meals to eat. You will literally piss out the protein if you take too much. Also remember that protein shake gets roughly
near 1k calories so if your a big guy trying to lose weight and its getting near bed time maybe skip the shake save the late night calories. If you also are going light on a day or doing only
one muscle I only usually take 1 scoop to save money and calories, but if you have the money or are trying to gain mass then two really wouldn't hurt but be aware you may be wasting it depending on your weight or not getting
enough in contrast.</p>

                         <p> <br>
Over the years Ive figured out a lot about cardio. A lot of people over do it. I used to run 13 miles when I played college basketball. My little brother motivated me to push my self to the limit.<br><br>
This in addition to a lot of things is why I had to bust my ass at the gym to keep what I had and plateu'd. One thing we tend to forget is cardio burns fat everywhere, but less on the area's we want
it to. You should do your cardio with that in mind. I really have found that 10-15 mins of cardio a day is the best. Anymore then that is burning your muscle.<br><br>

With the following info you need to check your self and see how it applies to you:

I recmmend 1 mile every day if you can. This really isn't that possible for most people so ideally do 1 mile four times a week on the days you workout, or do it like 3 times a week
on the days you dont workout.

If you are going for straight muscle mass avoid cardio and add more muscle groups into your days and max out of your workouts and sets and rest really good on your off days.
Me I need the cardio becaasue of my bad metabolism. <br><br>

Cardio Routines:
				 <strong>STRETCH BEFORE ALL CARDIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong>
<br><br>
				 <strong>Running outside</strong> is the best cardio you can get. However If you live in a junky city, unsafe environment, or have generically bad knee's or anxiety about people seeing you / your weight this
wont work for you.
You can do it on the treadmill too! However keep in mind if you are dragging your feet on the treadmill you aren't helping your self. You need to get those feet up and jog for real. If you are really serious and have no options you can even jog in place. I have been testing this recently and with a high knee pace / drop to kicking your legs up in the back when your tired for ~ 10 mins it is intense!
<br><br>
You can do all sorts on the treadmill, I recommend the following for your cardio:
Speed walking: 15 min - 20 min of speed walking if you cant handle jogging. 
<br><br>
				 <strong>Jogging:</strong> 12 mins of jogging, 1 minute walk + 10 minutes on 6 speed jogging + 1 minute rest. Great Great way to lose some fat. Not too long where you start burning arm fat but not to short where
you aren't sweating or raising your heart level. you can increase it to 2m or faster speeds.
<br><br>

				 <strong>Sprints:</strong> These are really hard to say cause everyone has different limits but you should aim for 3-4 sprints and 4-5 rests.
your sprints should be twice as long as your rests at minimum. I.e 1 min warmup + 2 min sprint + 1min walk + 1min sprint + 30 second walk + 1min sprint + 30 second walk ... i.e
<br><br>

Be smart with your cardio. If you need it DO it and dont skip it. If you dont then avoid it. Dont over due it and don't under do it. It doesn't feel good because its working! </p>

                  <p> I used to weigh 298 pounds and was deemed obese. I decided I didn't want to look like that and got a gym membership
and learned how to play basketball. After figuring out what workouts work and what things give the best results for me
I was able to lose over 100 pounds and keep it off 8 years later. I have trained and changed 11 people lives in person and many more over the internet using the things I have learned in my time. One thing you should know by now is everyone is different and we all require different things. You will learn your body and learn the tricks to it over time. Its never a one day, one week, or even one month process - but if its what you want you will take the steps and be there in no time.I hope this Guide has helped you in any shape or form.
