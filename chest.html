<p>Choose 3, and perform 3-5 (15, 10, 5, 2, 1, 1) sets with a warmup pause set of 15 reps and increasing weight with reducing reps (3-6 sets of 5 if bulking) for everything<br><br<strong>

	<strong>Flat Bench Press</strong> - Your normal bench press. Its a wonderful chest exercise for building pecs. If you want a flatter chest try to do pushups and lesser weight bench press with a wider grip and more reps.
Otherwise its not a bad thing to build some muscle on your chest since you will lose some from a good diet. I would start out with a flat bar and no weight and go from there to figure out your sweet spots. Once you are ready
Aim for something like this
Set 1: A set where you can do something like 10-15 reps I know its hard starting off but this is a low weight warm up pause set.
Example: I put 135 on and do 15 reps nice and slow with good form. Look up the proper benchpress form so you are engaging your triceps to help you with your lift.
Set 2: Add on minimum like 5-10 on each side , I usually add on 25 on each side and raise it up to 185 for this because of how low I go on the first set.
Try to aim for something like 6-11 reps, I usually get about 10 here.
Set 3: Add a functional difficult weight. For me this is 225, where I can get about 5 reps in solidly at this point. Dont be afraid to ask for a spotter, no one cares how much you lift honestly but they
will be glad to help you if you ask politely. This is your first set where it is near body weight or atleast a challenging weight. If you are bulking you would be doing a few sets of specifically this weight.
At this point you can choose to do a final burn out set - or if you are bulking continue your sets of the body / challenging weight. If you are trying to build up your numbers proceed slowly here without trying to max out.
<br>2 reps at 245 my next weight level  
2 reps at 255 my next weight level
1 rep at 265 my next weight level
1 rep at 275 my next weight level
and at 285 I get a spotter and struggle - so this is where I indicate that I shouldn't go to 285 because the goal isn't to max out. Start off small and dont get hurt, t
	this is a dangerous exercise please be safe.
<br><br>
       <strong>Decline bench press</strong> - This is the bench that your legs are raised and your head is closer to the ground. You should be able to do more then your flat bench, however if you did bench press first then
you will be tired naturally. Your triceps will be more engaged in this workout so if possible to chest before triceps in your days / rotations (same with shoulders). 
Numbers for things on bench really are hard to say there something you just have to try. I would start out with a flat bar and no weight and go from there to figure out your sweet spots.
Get a spotter if you can so you can explore your body and limits. Aim for 3 sets, if you have already done flat then go by how you feel and add in pushups if you can't.
<br><br>
	<strong>Incline bench press</strong> - Hardest one of the three. Dont expect to do a lot of weight, focus on your form and becareful not to hurt your shoulders. Its the bench press that you are basically sitting leaning back slightly.
This isn't an easy workout so if your starting off of have shoulder problems skip it. Come back to it eventually though because it really helps you fill out your chest properly. 
Aim for like 2 sets because you will be tired if you did the other benches. Otherwise go for 3 clean sets.
	<br><br>

	<strong>Flys</strong> - You can do this with a machine, cables, or dumbells - but it is the motion when you are basically going from a position with your arms stretched out and closing them in on the center of your chest.
This is a great and easy workout that you should add in once you get the meat done (benches or pushups). Aim for like 3 sets.
<br><br>
	<strong>Pushups</strong> - Standard old school pushups you did in gym class. You keep your arms shoulder width apart, your butt tucked in and lower your self till you have your chest an inch from the ground. 
	Numbers dont mean anything with bad form because you will build off balance muscles. Pushups are amazing, they not only give you a
great chest workout but are great for helping to lose weight due to the intensity of body weight exercises. Aim for 3 sets of 20, but realistically you will probably get sometrhing like 20 , 15, 10. which is fine. Do YOUR BEST
there is always openings for pushups. You can do it entirely as a workout set or as supplemental reps to even out missed reps from benching if you are having an off day.
	<br><br>

	<strong>Dumbell Press</strong> - This is a fantastic way to ease your self into bench pressing. Here you can use smaller dumb bells and get an idea of the motion / what you can handle. I really recommend you do this before benching if
you are a beginner. You also can do this safely without a spotter thats the best part! Aim for 3 sets, the weight with dumbells are harder then bench press so grab something medium and give it a shot and figure out what
	weight works for you. Make sure you are doing this on one of the benches that dont have slots for bench press or if you are at home you can lay flat on the ground.
	<br><br>

There are many others but these are the core workouts I recommend for you. Pick 3 that work the best for you, I do usually a flat bench, decline/incline if im at the gym - or pushups if im at home, and fly's - machine at gym and dumbells at home.
	<br><br>

	
There are tons of workouts find the 3 that work for you.
